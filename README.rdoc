== README

This site is pretty simple to setup - it's currently running as follows:

* Ruby 2.4.x
* Rails 5.0.x
* CentOS 6.8
* MySQL 5.x
* jQuery 1.12.x
* Phusion Passenger
* You'll need a Google geocode API key and DarkSky.net API key.  Both are free up to a certain number of calls per day.
* You'll also need two records in the database - one for the Dark Sky API info, and one for the Google info.  The info may change in the future but currently it looks like this:
- Google Information:
  - url:  https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?
  - requests per day: 2500
  - service name in the db: google (all lowercase)
- Dark Sky (previously Forecast) Information:
  - url:  https://darksky.net/dev/docs
  - requests per day: 1000
  - service name in the db: forecast (all lowercase)
